# CnCNet WebSocket Server
A WebSocket-based server for managing game lobbies and communications in CnCNet using [Socket.IO](https://socket.io/), TypeScript and Node.js. 

## ðŸš§ Project Status 
This project is currently in active development. 

## ðŸŽ¯ Aims
- Develop a working prototype to replace the current IRC-based game lobby communication in the XNA CnCNet client with WebSocket communications, ensuring real-time updates between players and hosts (e.g., instant map changes, game options, chat messages).
- Extend the WebSocket-based solution to replace all other IRC features, including chat, friend management, and other lobby interactions.
- Once stable, introduce an optional account system that supports guest and registered user logins, providing a seamless user experience with improved flexibility.
